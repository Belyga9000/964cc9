1. If data for the post will be coming from the API we would have to use asynchronous request to fetch data and work with it afterwards. If we are using only React and functional components we coult use useEffect hookto fetch API data and useState to store it. If we are using class components we could fetch data using componentDidMout(). If we are using Redux + React we could also use middleWare instead of a asynchronous function such as Saga or Thunk for API requests.

2. React requires stable keys for virtual dom since its one of the parameters that virtual dom checks to rerender specific component on state change, keys is one of those parameters. If by any chance our components will have same keys in react application, react will give us a warning and will render components anyway but those components will be working not as intended on state change.
